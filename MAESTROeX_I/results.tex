\section{Performance and Validation}

\subsection{AMR Performance}
Show 3D reacting bubble rise performance.
Show 3-level spherical performance (stats won't be as good but explain why: refining a larger percentage of grid)

\subsection{Scaling}
Scaling with OpenMP

\subsection{White Dwarf Convection}
white dwarf convection runs with 3 algorithms (original, new temporal, new temporal + irregular base state)

Show 3-level wdconvect
