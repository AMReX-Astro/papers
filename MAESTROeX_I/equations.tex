\section{Governing Equations}\label{sec:equations}
Low Mach number models for reacting flow were originally derived using asymptotic analysis
\citep{rehm1978equations,majda1985derivation} and used in terrestrial combustion applications
\citep{knio1999semi,day2000numerical}.  These models have been extended to nuclear flames
in astrophysical environments using adaptive algorithms in space and time \citep{Bell:2004}.
In Papers I-III, we extended this work and the atmospheric model by \citet{durran:1989} by deriving a model and algorithm suitable for stratified astrophysical flow.
We take the standard equations of reacting, compressible flow, and recast the equation
of state (EOS) as a divergence constraint on the velocity field.
The resulting model is a series of evolution equations for mass, momentum, and energy, subject
to an additional constraint on velocity.  The evolution equations are
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial(\rho X_k)}{\partial t} &=& -\nabla\cdot(\rho X_k\Ub) + \rho\omegadot_k,\label{eq:species}\\
\frac{\partial\Ub}{\partial t} &=& -\Ub\cdot\nabla\Ub  - \frac{\beta_0}{\rho}\nabla\left(\frac{\pi}{\beta_0}\right) - \frac{\rho-\rho_0}{\rho} g\eb_r,\label{eq:momentum}\\
\frac{\partial(\rho h)}{\partial t} &=& -\nabla\cdot(\rho h\Ub) + \frac{Dp_0}{Dt} + \rho\Hnuc.\label{eq:enthalpy}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\rho$, $\Ub$, and $h$ are the mass density,
velocity and specific enthalpy, respectively, and
$X_k$ are the mass fractions of species $k$ with associated
production rate $\omegadot_k$ and energy release per time per unit mass $\Hnuc$.
The species are constrained such that $\sum_k X_k = 1$ giving $\rho = \sum_k (\rho X_k)$ and
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot(\rho\Ub).
\end{equation}
The total pressure is decomposed into a one-dimensional hydrostatic base state
 pressure, $p_0 = p_0(r,t)$, and a dynamic pressure, $\pi = \pi(\xb,t)$, such that
$p = p_0 + \pi$ and $|\pi|/p_0 = \mathcal{O}({\rm Ma}^2)$ (we use $\xb$ to represent the Cartesian coordinate
directions of the full state and $r$ to represent the radial coordinate direction for the base state).
One way to mathematically think of the difference between $p_0$ and $\pi$ is that $\pi$ controls the velocity evolution 
in a way that forces the thermodynamic variables $(\rho,h,X_k)$ to evolve in a manner that is consistent with the EOS and $p_0$.\MarginPar{AJN - added this sentence; does it make sense?}

By comparing the momentum equation (\ref{eq:momentum}) to the momentum equation used in equation (2) in Paper V, we
note that we are using a formulation that enforces conservation of total energy in the
low Mach number system in the absence of external heating or viscous terms \citep{kleinpauluis,Vasil2013}.
We have previously validated this approach in modeling sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs using MAESTRO \citep{subChandra_II}.
We also define a one-dimensional base state density, $\rho_0 = \rho_0(r,t)$, that represents the lateral average (see Section \ref{Sec:Spatial}) of $\rho$ and is in hydrostatic equilibrium with $p_0$, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\nabla p_0 = -\rho_0 g\eb_r, \label{eq:HSE}
\end{equation}
where $g=g(r,t)$ is the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration and $\eb_r$ is the unit vector in the outward radial direction.
Here $\beta_0$ is a density-like variable that carries background stratification, defined as
\begin{equation}
\beta_0(r,t) = \rho_0(0,t)\exp\left(\int_0^r\frac{1}{\gammaonebar p_0}\frac{\partial p_0}{\partial r'}dr'\right),
\end{equation}
where $\gammaonebar$ is the lateral average of $\Gamma_1 = d(\log p)/d(\log\rho) |_s$ (evaluated with entropy, $s$, constant).
Thermal diffusion is not discussed in this paper, but we have previously described the modifications to the original algorithm required
for implicit thermal diffusion in \cite{XRB_I}; inclusion of these effects in the new algorithm presented here is straightforward.

Mathematically, equations (\ref{eq:momentum})-(\ref{eq:enthalpy}) must still be closed by the EOS.
This is done by taking the Lagrangian derivative of the EOS for pressure as a function of the thermodynamic variables,
substituting in the equations of motion for mass and energy,
and requiring that the pressure is a prescribed function of altitude and time based on the hydrostatic equilibrium condition.
See Papers I and II for details of this derivation.
The resulting equation is a divergence constraint on the velocity field,
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot(\beta_0\Ub) = \beta_0\left(S - \frac{1}{\gammaonebar p_0}\frac{\partial p_0}{\partial t}\right).\label{eq:U divergence}
\end{equation}
The expansion term, $S$, incorporates local compressibility effects due to compositional changes and heat release from reactions,
\begin{equation}
S = -\sigma\sum_k\xi_k\omegadot_k + \frac{1}{\rho p_\rho}\sum_k p_{X_k}\omegadot_k + \sigma\Hnuc,\label{eq:S}
\end{equation}
where
$p_{X_k} \equiv \left. \partial p / \partial X_k \right|_{\rho,T,X_{j,j\ne k}}$,
$\xi_k \equiv \left. \partial h /\partial X_k \right |_{p,T,X_{j,j\ne k}}$,
$p_\rho \equiv \left.\partial p/\partial \rho \right |_{T, X_k}$, and
$\sigma \equiv p_T/(\rho c_p p_\rho)$, with $p_T \equiv \left. \partial p / \partial
T \right|_{\rho, X_k}$ and $c_p \equiv \left.  \partial h / \partial T
\right|_{p,X_k}$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.

To summarize, we model evolution equations for momentum, mass, and energy, equations (\ref{eq:momentum})-(\ref{eq:enthalpy}) subject to a divergence constraint on the velocity, equation (\ref{eq:U divergence}), and the hydrostatic equilibrium condition, equation (\ref{eq:HSE}).
