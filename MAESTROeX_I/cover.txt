Dear Editor,

I have included the tex file, bibliography, and figures for our submission,
"MAESTROeX: A Massively Parallel Low Mach Number Astrophysical Solver".
This manuscript is a continuation of prior research conducted and published by Nonaka et al. in ApJSS titled "MAESTRO: An Adaptive Low Mach Number Hydrodynamics Algorithm for Stellar Flows". Please let me know if there is anything else required.

Thank you,
Duoming (Doreen) Fan
