%% This manuscript uses the AASTeX v6.2 LaTeX 2e macros
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The

%%
%%
%% using aastex version 6.2
\documentclass{aastex62}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be envoked like this:

%% \documentclass[argument]{aastex62}
%%
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.

\title{MAESTROeX: A Massively Parallel Low Mach Number Astrophysical Solver}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.2 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for
%% calling author and affilations. The change was necessary to implement
%% autoindexing of affilations which prior was a manual process that could
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% arguement which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.2 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.2 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to

We present MAESTROeX, a massively parallel solver for low Mach number astrophysical flows.
Our model equations allow for long-time integration for highly subsonic flows compared to compressible approaches.
The code leverages the new AMReX framework for block-structured adaptive mesh refinement calculations, and also provides additional algorithmic features from the original MAESTRO code.
We present a new temporal integration option that is much simpler than our previous approach while retaining the same order order of accuracy.
We also provide a more accurate spatial discretization for mapping the base state onto the full state Cartesian grid.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Many astrophysical flows are highly subsonic; sound waves carry sufficiently little energy that they do not significantly affect the convective dynamics of the system.
In many of these flows, modeling long-time convective dynamics are of interest, and numerical approaches based on compressible hydrodynamics are intractable, even on modern supercomputers.
One approach to this problem is to use low Mach number models.
In a low Mach number approach, sound waves are eliminated from the governing equations while retaining compressibilitiy effects due to, e.g., nuclear energy release, compositional changes, and thermal diffusion.
The resulting model can be numerically integrated with much larger time steps than a compressible model.

Previously, we have developed the low Mach number astrophysical solver, MAESTRO.
Low Mach number models have been developed for a variety of contexts including combustion \citep{day2000numerical}, atmospherics \citep{duarte2015low}, and elastic solids \citep{abbate2017all}.
The low Mach number model in MAESTRO is unique in that it is specifically designed for astrophysical settings with significant atmospheric stratification.
Central to the algorithm is a stratified background (or base) state density and pressure held in hydrostatic equilibrium, and also vary as a function of altitude and time.
MAESTRO is suitable for for spherical stars, as well as planar simulations of local dynamics.

The key numerical developments of the original MAESTRO algorithm are presented in a series of papers which we refer to as Papers I-V:
\begin{itemize}
\item In Paper I \citep{MAESTRO_I}, we derive the low Mach number equation set from the fully compressible equations.
\item In Paper II \citep{MAESTRO_II}, we incorporate the effects atmospheric expansion through the use of a time-dependent background state.
\item In Paper III \citep{MAESTRO_III}, we incorporate reactions and the associated coupling to the hydrodynamics.
\item In Paper IV \citep{MAESTRO_IV}, we describe our treatment of spherical stars in a three-dimensional Cartesian geometry.
\item In Paper V \citep{MAESTRO_V}, we describe the use of block-structured adaptive mesh refinement to focus spatial resolution in regions of interest.
\end{itemize} 

Since then, there have been many scientific investigations using MAESTRO, which include additional algorithmic enhancements.  Topics include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The convective phase preceding Chandrasekhar mass models for type Ia supernovae \citep{MAESTRO_convection,MAESTRO_AMR,MAESTRO_CASTRO}.
\item Convection in massive stars \citep{Gilet:2013}.
\item Sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs \citep{subChandra_I,subChandra_II}.  In the latter paper we introduced an optional modification to the momentum equation of velocity constraint that conserves total energy, can give results closer to compressible codes of convective dynamics, including low density regions at the surface of a star.
\item Type I X-ray bursts \citep{XRB_I,XRB_II,XRB_III}.  In \cite{XRB_I} we discuss the modifications required for implicit thermal conduction, as well as an additional ``volume discrepancy'' modification to the velocity constraint to force the species and enthalpy to evolve in a manner consistent with the background pressure.
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we characterize the performance of the MAESTROeX algorithm compared to the previous implementation.
We also develop simpler, alternative temporal integrators, with a longer term goal of developing high-order coupling schemes.
We also present a new treatment of the base state mapping to Cartesian grids for spherical problsm.

\section{Governing Equations}
The derivation of the low Mach number hydrodynamics equations is given in Papers I-III.
We take the standard equations of reacting, compressible flow, and recast the equation
of state as a divergence constraint on the velocity field.  This is done by taking
the Langrangian derivative of the equation of state for pressure as a function of the
density, composition, and enthalpy, enforcing the constraint that the pressure is
a prescribed function of altitutde and time based on the hydrostatic equilibrium condition,
and substituting the equations for species and enthalpy in the resulting Lagrangian derivative.
The resulting equations are
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial\Ub}{\partial t} &=& -\Ub\cdot\nabla\Ub  - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla\pi - \frac{\rho-\rho_0}{\rho} g\eb_r,\label{eq:momentum}\\
\frac{\partial(\rho X_k)}{\partial t} &=& -\nabla\cdot(\rho X_k\Ub) + \rho\omegadot_k,\label{eq:species}\\
\frac{\partial(\rho h)}{\partial t} &=& -\nabla\cdot(\rho h\Ub) + \frac{Dp_0}{Dt} + \rho\Hnuc,\label{eq:enthalpy}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot(\beta_0\Ub) = \beta_0\left(S - \frac{1}{\gammaonebar p_0}\frac{\partial p_0}{\partial t}\right).\label{eq:U divergence}
\end{equation}
Here $\rho$, $\Ub$, and $h$ are the mass density,
velocity and specific enthalpy, respectively, and
$X_k$ are the mass fractions of species $k$ with associated
production rate $\omegadot_k$.  The species are constrained
such that $\sum_k X_k = 1$ giving $\rho = \sum_k (\rho X_k)$ and
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot(\rho\Ub).
\end{equation}
Here $\Hnuc$ is the nuclear energy generation rate per unit mass.
The pressure is decomposed into a hydrostatic base state
 pressure, $p_0 = p_0(r,t)$, and a dynamic pressure, $\pi = \pi(\xb,t)$, such that 
$|\pi|/p_0 = \mathcal{O}(M^2)$ (we use $\xb$ to represent the Cartesian coordinate 
directions of the full state and $r$ to represent the radial coordinate direction for 
the base state).  We also define a base state density, $\rho_0 = \rho_0(r,t)$, 
which is in hydrostatic equilibrium with $p_0$, i.e., 
$\nabla p_0 = -\rho_0 g\eb_r$, where $g=g(r,t)$ is
the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration and $\eb_r$ is the unit vector in the
outward radial direction. 

Mathematically, equations (\ref{eq:momentum})-(\ref{eq:enthalpy}) must still be closed by the equation of state which we
express as a divergence constraint on the velocity field (\ref{eq:U divergence}),
\MarginPar{This is different from the Jacobs 2016 paper where we switched to alt\_energy\_fix.}
where $\beta_0$ is a density-like variable that carries background stratification, defined as
\begin{equation}
\beta_0(r,t) = \rho_0(0,t)\exp\left(\int_0^r\frac{1}{\gammaonebar p_0}\frac{\partial p_0}{\partial r'}dr'\right),
\end{equation}
where $\gammaonebar$ is the lateral average of $\Gamma_1 = d(\log p)/d(\log\rho)$ at constant entropy.
The expansion term, $S$, incorporates local compressibility effects due to heat release from reactions, compositional changes, and external sources,
\begin{equation}
S = -\sigma\sum_k\xi_k\omegadot_k + \frac{1}{\rho p_\rho}\sum_k p_{X_k}\omegadot_k + \sigma\Hnuc,\label{eq:S}
\end{equation}
where $p_{X_k} \equiv \left. \partial p / \partial X_k
\right|_{\rho,T,X_{j,j\ne k}}$, $\xi_k \equiv \left. \partial h /
\partial X_k \right |_{p,T,X_{j,j\ne k}},
p_\rho \equiv \left.
\partial p/\partial \rho \right |_{T, X_k}$, and $\sigma \equiv
p_T/(\rho c_p p_\rho)$, with $p_T \equiv \left. \partial p / \partial
T \right|_{\rho, X_k}$ and $c_p \equiv \left.  \partial h / \partial T
\right|_{p,X_k}$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.

Previously we adopted an approach where we split the velocity into a base state component, $w_0$, and a local velocity $\Ubt$, so that
\begin{equation}
\Ub = w_0(r,t)\eb_r + \Ubt(\xb,t).
\end{equation}
We used $w_0$ to provide an estimate of the base state density evolution over a time step.
In our new simplified approach, we instead use a predictor-corrector approach for evolving the base state.

\section{Using Exact Spherical Base States on Irregular Grid} \label{sec:exactbasestate}

\subsection{Potential Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How do we define \verb|r_edge_loc| for irregularly-spaced base states whose cell-centered values are defined at $r_m=\Delta x\sqrt{\frac{3}{4} + 2m}$?
\item We would stil need to approximate the values at edges when advecting the base states (i.e. $\rho_0^{\nph,\pred}$). This may affect the nice properties we would get with exact cell-centered base state values.
\item Excessive memory storage may be required (\verb|nr_irreg >> nr_fine|).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A Possible Solution}
We could choose to no longer advect the base states for both predictor and corrector steps. This would solve the problems with computing state values at cell edges. Instead, we propose to only update the base states $\rho_0$ and $p_0$ by computing the average of the full state values after advecting the full states. This would result in the following changes in the algorithm from Paper V:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Steps 4 and 8 will be greatly simplified, leading to a more efficient algorithm.
\item There is no longer a need for $w_0$, so we can use the full velocity $\Ub$ instead of $\Ubt$. As a consequence, $\eta$ and $\psi$ also do not need to be computed. This has the added advantage of saving some memory storage by removing many of the terms needed when we decided to split terms into its base state and perturbation state in our previous implementation.
\item By placing the base states exactly at cell-centers, we eliminate interpolation errors and simplify the existing code.
\end{enumerate}
%

\subsection{Main Algorithm Description}\label{Sec:Main Algorithm Description}
\MarginPar{talk about cutoff densities}
We now describe the proposed algorithm, making frequent use of the
shorthand notations mentioned in Paper V, Appendix A3.  In summary, in the predictor step ({\bf
  Steps 2-5}) we use an estimate of the expansion term, $S$, to
compute a preliminary solution at the new time level, denoted with an
``$n+1,\star$'' superscript.  In the corrector step ({\bf Steps 6-9}),
we use the results from the predictor step to compute a more accurate
expansion term, and compute the final solution at the new time level,
denoted with an ``$n+1$'' superscript.  We use Strang-splitting to
achieve second-order accuracy in time.

\MarginPar{AJN: eliminated references to volume discrepancy for now; we'd only use it for planar at the moment, don't want to open up that can of worms here}

\begin{description}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 0
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\item[Step 0] {\em Initialization}
The initialization step only occurs at the beginning of the simulation.
The initialization step computes initial values for $\pi^{-\myhalf}$, , $\eta_{\rho}^{-\myhalf}$, 
$\psi^{-\myhalf}$, $S^0$, and $S^1$ for use in time stepping routine.  
We pass through {\bf Step 1} -- {\bf Step 12}, but only keep these values.
The initial values for $\Ub^0, \rho^0, (\rho h)^0, X_k^0, T^0,
\rho_0^0, p_0^0$, and $\overline{\Gamma}_1^0$ are specified from the problem-dependent
initial conditions.  The initial time step, $\dt^0$, is computed as in
Paper III.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 1
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item[Step 1] {\em React the full state through the first time interval of $\dt / 2.$}

Call {\bf React State}$[(\rho X_k)^n, (\rho h)^n, p_0^n] \rightarrow [(\rho X_k)^{(1)}, (\rho h)^{(1)}, (\rho \omegadot_k)^{(1)}, (\rho \Hnuc)^{(1)}]$.
\MarginPar{AJN: I think we can simplify the description here... this is somewhat confusing now.}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 2
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\item[Step 2] {\em Compute the provisional time-centered expansion,
    $S^{\nph,\star}$.}

We compute an estimate for the time-centered expansion term in the velocity
divergence constraint.  Following \citet{Bell:2004}, we extrapolate
to the half-time using $S$ at the previous and current
time steps,
\begin{equation}
S^{\nph,\star} = S^n + \frac{\dt^n}{2} \frac{S^n - S^{n-1}}{\dt^{n-1}}.
\end{equation}
Note that in the first time step we average $S^0$ and $S^1$ from the
initialization step.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 3
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item[Step 3] {\em Construct the provisional time-centered advective velocity on
edges, $\uadvone$.}

Using equation (\ref{eq:momentum}), 
we compute time-centered edge velocities, $\uadvonedag$, using
$\Ub^n$.  The $\dagger$ superscript refers to the
fact that the predicted velocity field does not satisfy the divergence
constraint.  We then construct $\uadvone$ from $\uadvonedag$
using a MAC projection.
We note that $\uadvone$ satisfies the divergence constraint
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \left(\beta_0^n \uadvone\right) = \beta_0^n \left(S^{\nph,\star} - \frac{1}{\overline{\Gamma}_1^np_0^n}\psi^{n-\myhalf} \right),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \beta_0^n = \beta_0 \left(\rho_0^n, p_0^n, \overline{\Gamma}_1^n\right),
\end{equation}
where $\beta_0$ is computed as described in Appendix C of Paper III.

It should also be noted that we have found it better to approximate 
the temporal changes in base pressure as 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial p_0}{\partial t} \approx \psi = \eta_{\rho} g
\end{equation}
instead of using the lagged pressure changes from previous time $t^{n-1}$ 
in the predictor step.

\MarginPar{We may not need $\rho_0$ if we predict $\rho X$ or $\rho$ and $X$.  AJN: If we end up keeping prediction of $\rho'$ and $X$, and $(\rho h)'$ we need to summarize this, particularly since $\rho_0$ and $(\rho h)_0$ treatment differs from previous papers.}

\item Evolve $(\rho X_k)^{(1)} \rightarrow (\rho X_k)^{(2),\star}$ using
\begin{equation}
(\rho X_k)^{(2),\star} = (\rho X_k)^{(1)}
  - \dt \left\{ \nabla \cdot \left[ \uadvone (\rho X_k)^{\nph,\pred} \right] \right\},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\rho^{(2),\star} = \sum_k (\rho X_k)^{(2),\star},
\qquad
X_k^{(2),\star} = (\rho X_k)^{(2),\star} / \rho^{(2),\star}.
\end{equation}

\end{enumerate}

\item Update $\rho_0$ by setting $\rho_0^{n+1,\star} =$ {\bf Avg}$(\rho^{(2),\star})$.

\item Update $p_0$ by calling
{\bf Enforce HSE}$[p_0^n,\rho_0^{n+1,\star}] \rightarrow [p_0^{n+1,\star}]$.

\item Update the enthalpy using a discretized version of equation
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial(\rho h)}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot(\rho h\Ub) + \frac{Dp_0}{Dt} + \rho\Hnuc,
\end{equation}
%
again omitting the reaction and heating terms
since we already accounted for
them in {\bf React State}.  This equation takes the form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial (\rho h)}{\partial t}  = - \nabla \cdot (\Ub \rho h) + \frac{\partial p_0}{\partial t} + (\Ub \cdot \eb_r) \frac{\partial p_0}{\partial r}.
\end{equation}
For spherical geometry, we solve the
analytically equivalent form,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial (\rho h)}{\partial t}  = - \nabla \cdot (\Ub \rho h) + \frac{\partial p_0}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\Ub p_0) - p_0 \nabla \cdot \Ub.
\end{equation}
The update consists of two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{{\bf \roman{enumii}}.}

\item Compute the time-centered enthalpy edge state, $(\rho h)^{\nph,\pred},$
  for the conservative update of $(\rho h)^{(1)}$
  using $\Ub = \uadvone$ and $(\rho h)^n$,

\item Evolve $(\rho h)^{(1)} \rightarrow (\rho h)^{(2),\star}$.
\begin{description}
\item For planar geometry,
\begin{eqnarray}
(\rho h)^{(2),\star}
&=& (\rho h)^{(1)} \nonumber \\
&&- \dt^n \left\{ \nabla \cdot \left[ \uadvone (\rho h)^{\nph,\pred} \right] \right\} \nonumber \\
&& + \dt^n \left(\uadvone \cdot \eb_r\right) \left(\frac{\partial p_0}{\partial r} \right)^{n} \nonumber \\
&& + \dt^n \psi^{n-\myhalf},
\end{eqnarray}

\item For spherical geometry,
\begin{eqnarray}
(\rho h)^{(2),\star}
&=& (\rho h)^{(1)} \nonumber \\
&&- \dt^n \left\{ \nabla \cdot \left[ \uadvone (\rho h)^{\nph,\pred} \right] \right\} \nonumber \\
&& + \dt^n \left \{ \nabla \cdot \left (\uadvone p_0^{n} \right ) - p_0^{n} \nabla \cdot \uadvone \right \} \nonumber \\
&& + \dt^n \psi^{n-\myhalf},
\end{eqnarray}
\end{description}

\end{enumerate}

Then, for each Cartesian cell where $\rho^{(2),\star} < \rho_\mathrm{cutoff}$,
we recompute enthalpy using
\begin{equation}
(\rho h)^{(2),\star} = \rho^{(2),\star}h\left(\rho^{(2),\star},p_0^{n+1,\star},X_k^{(2),\star}\right).
\end{equation}

\item Update the temperature using the equation of state:
$T^{(2),\star} =
  T(\rho^{(2),\star}, h^{(2),\star}, X_k^{(2),\star})$ (planar geometry) or
$T^{(2),\star} =
  T(\rho^{(2),\star}, p_0^{n+1,\star}, X_k^{(2),\star})$ (spherical geometry).
\end{enumerate}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 5

\item[Step 5] {\em React the full state through a second time interval of $\dt / 2.$}

Call {\bf React State}$[ (\rho X_k)^{(2),\star}, (\rho h)^{(2),\star}, p_0^{n+1,\star}]$\\
\phantom{ }\hfill $\rightarrow [ (\rho X_k)^{n+1,\star}, (\rho h)^{n+1,\star}, (\rho \omegadot_k)^{(2),\star}, (\rho \Hnuc)^{(2),\star} ].$

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 6
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item[Step 6] {\em Compute the time-centered expansion, $S^{\nph,\star}$.}

\item First, compute $S^{n+1,\star}$ with
\begin{equation}
S^{n+1,\star} =  -\sigma  \sum_k  \xi_k  (\omegadot_k)^{(2),\star}  + \frac{1}{\rho^{n+1,\star} p_\rho} \sum_k p_{X_k}  ({\omegadot}_k)^{(2),\star} + \sigma \Hnuc^{(2),\star},
\end{equation}
  where $(\omegadot_k)^{(2),\star} = (\rho \omegadot_k)^{(2),\star} /
  \rho^{(2),\star}$ and the thermodynamic quantities are defined using
  $\rho^{n+1,\star}, X_k^{n+1,\star},$ and $T^{n+1,\star}$ as inputs to
  the equation of state.  Then, define
\begin{equation}
 S^{\nph} = \frac{S^n + S^{n+1,\star}}{2},
\end{equation}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 7
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item[Step 7] {\em Construct the time-centered advective velocity on edges, $\uadvtwo$.}

The procedure to construct $\uadvtwodag$ is identical to the procedure
for computing $\uadvonedag$ in {\bf Step 3}, but uses
the updated value $S^{\nph}$ rather than $S^{\nph,\star}$.
Also, the temporal changes of $p_0$ are now computed directly instead of 
approximated using $\psi$.
We note that $\uadvtwo$ satisfies the divergence constraint
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \left(\beta_0^{\nph} \uadvtwo\right) =
\beta_0^{\nph} \left(S^{\nph} - \frac{1}{\overline{\Gamma}_1^{n+\myhalf}p_0^{n+1,\star}}\frac{p_0^{n+1,\star}-p_0^n}{\Delta t^n}\right),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\beta_0^{\nph} = \frac{ \beta_0^n +  \beta_0^{n+1,\star} }{2};
\qquad
 \beta_0^{n+1,\star} = \beta_0 \left(\rho_0^{n+1,\star}, p_0^{n+1,\star}, \overline{\Gamma}_1^{n+1,\star}\right),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\overline{\Gamma}_1^{\nph} = \frac{ \overline{\Gamma}_1^n +  \overline{\Gamma}_1^{n+1,\star} }{2}.
\end{equation}

\item[Step 8] {\em Advect the base state and full state through a time interval of $\dt.$}

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{{\bf \Alph{enumi}}}

\item Update $(\rho X_k)$.  This step is identical to {\bf Step 4A} except we use
  the updated values $\uadvtwo$ and $\rho_0^{(2a)}$ rather than
  $\uadvone$ and $\rho_0^{(2a),\star}$.  In particular:

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{{\bf \roman{enumii}}.}

\item Compute the time-centered species edge states, $(\rho X_k)^{\nph,\pred}$,
  for the conservative update of $(\rho X_k)^{(1)}$ using $\Ub = \uadvtwo$ and
  $\rho_0^n$.

\item Evolve $(\rho X_k)^{(1)} \rightarrow (\rho X_k)^{(2)}$ using
\begin{equation}
(\rho X_k)^{(2)} = (\rho X_k)^{(1)}
- \dt \left\{ \nabla \cdot \left[\uadvtwo (\rho X_k)^{\nph,\pred} \right] \right\},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\rho^{(2)} = \sum_k (\rho X_k)^{(2)},
\qquad
X_k^{(2)} = (\rho X_k)^{(2)} / \rho^{(2)}.
\end{equation}

\end{enumerate}

\item Update $\rho_0$ by setting $\rho_0^{n+1} =$ {\bf Avg}$(\rho^{(2)})$.

\item Update $p_0$ by calling
{\bf Enforce HSE}$[p_0^n,\rho_0^{n+1}] \rightarrow [p_0^{n+1}]$.

\item Update the enthalpy.  This step is identical to {\bf Step 4D} except we use
  the updated values $\uadvtwo, \rho_0^{n+1}, (\rho h)_0^{n+1}$, and $p_0^{n+\myhalf}$
  rather than
  $\uadvone, \rho_0^{n+1,\star}, (\rho h)_0^{n+1,\star}$, and $p_0^n$.
  Also, the temporal changes of $p_0$ are now computed directly instead of 
  approximated using $\psi$.
  In particular:
\MarginPar{Again, we may not need $\rho_0$ and $(\rho h)_0$.}

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{{\bf \roman{enumii}}.}

\item Compute the time-centered enthalpy edge state, $(\rho h)^{\nph,\pred},$
  for the conservative update of $(\rho h)^{(1)}$.

\item Evolve $(\rho h)^{(1)} \rightarrow (\rho h)^{(2)}$.
\begin{description}
\item For planar geometry,
\begin{eqnarray}
(\rho h)^{(2)}
&=& (\rho h)^{(1)} - \dt \left\{ \nabla \cdot \left[ \uadvtwo (\rho h)^{\nph,\pred} \right] \right\} \nonumber \\
&& + \dt \left(\uadvtwo \cdot \eb_r\right) \left(\frac{\partial p_0}{\partial r} \right)^\nph \nonumber \\
&& + \dt \left( \frac{p_0^{n+1} - p_0^n}{\dt^n} \right),
\end{eqnarray}

\item For spherical geometry,
\begin{eqnarray}
(\rho h)^{(2)}
&=& (\rho h)^{(1)} - \dt \left\{ \nabla \cdot \left[ \uadvtwo (\rho h)^{\nph,\pred} \right] \right\} \nonumber \\
&& + \dt \left[ \nabla \cdot \left (\uadvtwo p_0^{\nph} \right ) - p_0^{\nph} \nabla \cdot \uadvtwo \right] \nonumber \\
&& + \dt \left( \frac{p_0^{n+1} - p_0^n}{\dt^n} \right),
\end{eqnarray}
\end{description}
where $p_0^\nph$ is defined as $p_0^\nph = (p_0^n+p_0^{n+1})/2$.

\end{enumerate}

Then, for each Cartesian cell where $\rho^{(2)} < \rho_\mathrm{cutoff}$, we recompute enthalpy using
\begin{equation}
(\rho h)^{(2)} = \rho^{(2)}h\left(\rho^{(2)},p_0^{n+1},X_k^{(2)}\right).
\end{equation}

\item Update the temperature using the equation of state:
$T^{(2)} =
   T(\rho^{(2)}, h^{(2)}, X_k^{(2)})$ (planar geometry) or
$T^{(2)} =
   T(\rho^{(2)}, p_0^{n+1}, X_k^{(2)})$ (spherical geometry).

\item Define a radial cell-centered $\etarho^{\nph}$.

\begin{description}
\item For planar geometry, $\etarho = \overline{\rho'(\Ub\cdot\eb_r)}$,
\begin{equation}
 \etarho^{\nph} =  {\rm {\bf Avg}} \sum_k \left[ \left(\uadvtwo \cdot \eb_r \right) (\rho X_k)^{\nph,\pred} \right]
\end{equation}
\item For spherical geometry, first construct 
$\etarho^{{\rm cart},\nph} = [\rho'(\Ub\cdot\eb_r)]^{\nph}$ on Cartesian cell centers using:
\begin{equation}
\etarho^{{\rm cart},\nph} = \left[\left(\frac{\rho^{(1)}+\rho^{(2)}}{2}\right)-\left(\frac{\rho_0^n+\rho_0^{n+1}}{2}\right)\right] \cdot \left( \uadvtwo \cdot \eb_r \right).
\end{equation}
Then,
\begin{equation}
\etarho^{\nph,\star} = {\rm {\bf Avg}}\left(\etarho^{{\rm cart},\nph}\right).
\end{equation}
\end{description}


\item Compute $\psi^{\nph}$: 
\begin{equation}
\psi_j^{\nph} = \eta_{\rho,j}^{\nph} g.
\end{equation}

\end{enumerate}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 9
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item[Step 9] {\em React the full state through a second time interval of $\dt / 2.$}

Call {\bf React State}$[(\rho X_k)^{(2)},(\rho h)^{(2)}, p_0^{n+1}] \rightarrow [(\rho X_k)^{n+1}, (\rho h)^{n+1}, (\rho \omegadot_k)^{(2)}, (\rho \Hnuc)^{(2)}].$

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 10
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item[Step 10] {\em Define the new time expansion, $S^{n+1}$, and $\overline{\Gamma}_1^{n+1}$.}

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{{\bf \Alph{enumi}}}
\item Define
\begin{equation}
  S^{n+1} =  -\sigma  \sum_k  \xi_k (\omegadot_k)^{(2)}  + \sigma \Hnuc^{(2)} +
  \frac{1}{\rho^{n+1} p_\rho} \sum_k p_{X_k}  ({\omegadot}_k)^{(2)},
\end{equation}
where $(\omegadot_k)^{(2)} = (\rho \omegadot_k)^{(2)} / \rho^{(2)}$
and the thermodynamic quantities are defined using $\rho^{n+1}$,
$X_k^{n+1}$, and $T^{n+1}$ as inputs to the equation of state.

\item Define
\begin{equation}
\overline{\Gamma}_1^{n+1} = {\rm{\bf Avg}}\left[\Gamma_1\left(\rho^{n+1}, p_0^{n+1},
X_k^{n+1}\right) \right].
\end{equation}

\end{enumerate}


%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 11
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item[Step 11] {\em Update the velocity}.

First, we compute the time-centered edge velocities, $\Ub^{\nph,\pred}$.
Then, we define
\begin{equation}
\rho^\nph = \frac{\rho^n + \rho^{n+1}}{2}, \qquad \rho_0^\nph = \frac{\rho_0^n + \rho_0^{n+1}}{2}.
\end{equation}
We update the velocity field $\Ub^n$ to $\Ub^{n+1,\dagger}$ by discretizing
equation (\ref{eq:momentum}) as
\begin{eqnarray}
\Ub^{n+1,\dagger}
&=& \Ub^n - \dt \left[\uadvtwo \cdot \nabla \Ub^{\nph,\pred} \right] \nonumber \\
&& - \dt \left[ \frac{1}{\rho^\nph} \mathbf{G} \pi^\nmh + \frac{\left(\rho^\nph-\rho_0^\nph\right)}{\rho^\nph} g^{\nph} \eb_r \right],\nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{G}$ approximates a cell-centered gradient from nodal
data.  Again, the $\dagger$ superscript refers
to the fact that the updated velocity does not satisfy the divergence
constraint.

Finally, we use an approximate nodal projection to define $\Ub^{n+1}$
from $\Ub^{n+1,\dagger},$  such that $\Ub^{n+1}$ approximately
satisfies
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \left(\beta_0^{n+1} \Ub^{n+1} \right)
= \beta_0^{n+1} S^{n+1},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\beta_0^{n+1} = \beta \left(\rho_0^{n+1}, p_0^{n+1}, \overline{\Gamma}_1^{n+1}, g^{n+1}\right).
\end{equation}
As part of the projection we also define the new-time perturbational pressure,
$\pi^\nph.$  This projection necessarily differs from the MAC projection used in
{\bf Step 3} and {\bf Step 7} because the velocities in those steps are defined
on edges and $\Ub^{n+1}$ is defined at cell centers, requiring different divergence
and gradient operators.  Details of the approximate projection are given in Paper III.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% STEP 12
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item[Step 12] {\em Compute a new $\dt.$}

Compute $\dt$ for the next time step with a similar procedure described in
\S 3.4 of Paper III. However, we are using $\Ub^{n+1}$
as computed in {\bf Step 11} instead of $w_0$ and $\Ubt^{n+1}$ as in Paper V.
The following constraints need to be satisfied.

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{{\bf \Alph{enumi}}}
\item Use standard CFL condition for explicit methods using CFL factor $\sigma^{\mathrm{CFL}}$.
  For a calculation in $n_{\mathrm{dim}}$ dimensions ($n_{\mathrm{dim}}=2$ or 3),
  the first constraint is
\begin{equation}
\dt_{\Ub} = \sigma^\mathrm{CFL}  \min_{i=1\ldots n_\mathrm{dim}} \left \{ \dt_i \right \}\enskip,
\end{equation}
  where
\begin{equation}
\dt_i = \min_{\bf x}  \left \{ \frac{\Delta x_i}{\left | \Ub \right |}  \right \}\enskip.
\end{equation}

\item Use the forcing terms rather than the velocities.
  This constraint is necessary when a calculation is started from rest,
  since in that case the velocity-based time step would be infinite. Define
\begin{equation}
\dt_{\rm F} = \min_{i=1\ldots n_\mathrm{dim}} \left \{ \dt_{\rm F_i} \right \}\enskip,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\dt_{\rm F_i} = \sqrt{2 \Delta x_i / {F_i}_\mathrm{max}}\enskip,
\end{equation}
where ${F_i}_\mathrm{max}$ is the maximum buoyancy force in the
$i^\mathrm{th}$ coordinate direction.

\item To prevent local expansion from numerically emptying a cell,
  we require that the density be reduced by no more than 40\% in a single time step.
  This constraint is expressed as $\dt \leq \dt_S$ where
\begin{equation}
 \Delta t_S \; (\nabla \cdot \Ub)  \leq 0.40 \enskip ,
\end{equation}
  in every cell.

\end{enumerate}

\end{description}

\noindent This completes one step of the algorithm.
