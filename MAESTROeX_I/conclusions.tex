\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
Our new implementation of the MAESTRO code in the AMReX software framework 

Our future scientific investigations include convection in massive rotating stars, \citep{heger2000presupernova}, the convective Urca process in white dwarfs \citep{willcox2016type}, solar physics \citep{wood2018self}, and magnetohydrodynamics \citep{wood2015three,wood2011sun}.

Our future algorithmic enhancements include more accurate and higher-order multiphysics coupling strategies byased on spectral deferred corrections \cite{dutt2000spectral,bourlioux2003high}.
This framework has been successfully used in terrestrial combustion \cite{pazner2016high,nonaka2018conservative}

Our software enhancements will include GPU implementation.
