\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

science: rotation, solar physics, MHD

algorithm: SDC \cite{dutt2000spectral}, high-order, multi-implicit \cite{bourlioux2003high}.
Consider SDC ideas used for terrestrial combustion \cite{pazner2016high,nonaka2018conservative}

implementation: GPUs.  Forward cite next CASTRO paper with GPU strategy.
