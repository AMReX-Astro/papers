These runs were done with Castro and Microphysics on the astronum_sdc_plot
branch.  This branch has some prints in the react routines and VODE
righthand side to output the state as a function of time.

The Detonation problem was run, with inputs-det-x.SDC and probin-det-x.SDC

The SDC run was done for 200 steps and then we restarted both the Strang
and SDC from there to get the diagnostics, outputting in zone 465, which is
just behind the detonation.
