\begin{abstract}
Helium detonations can be challenging to model because of the
difficulty in accurately coupling hydrodynamics and reactions.  This
is particularly acute in the ash of the detonation where nuclear
statistical equilibrium is established.  We look a several different
methods of coupling explicit hydrodynamics and stiff reaction sources,
applied to detonations which reach NSE conditions.  This is all done
in the framework of the \castro\ hydrodynamics code, and all algorithm
implementations are freely available.

\section{Introduction}\label{Sec:Introduction}

Reactive flow can be challenging to model when the timescale for
changes in the nuclear abundances due to reactions is comparable to
the hydrodynamical timescales.  Traditional methods of coupling
hydrodynamics and reactions used in astrophysics use operator
splitting---each physical process acts on the output of the previous
process.  This makes it easy to add physics in a modular way to a
simulation code, but competition between physical processes can cause
the coupling to breakdown.  In general, the error in the splitting
controlled by the timestep.

A particular difficult phase of evolution to model is the nuclear
statistic equilibrium that sets in with helium burning for
temperatures in excess of $4\times 10^9~\mathrm{K}$.  Physically, the
forward and reverse rates should balance leading to an equilibrium.
With operator splitting, an NSE region will have a large positive flow
through the network in a zone in one step followed by a large negative
flow over the next timestep, as the code struggles to produce an
equilibrium.  This large change in abundances (and large alternately
positive and negative energy generation rates) can be a challenge for
a code.  The easiest way to improve the coupling is to cut the
timestep, but this makes simulations prohibitively expensive.
Sometimes the burning is simply halted on a zone-by-zone basis when
NSE conditions are reached (e.g., as in \citealt{hedet}).
Alternately, at high temperatures, a reaction network can be replaced
with a table of NSE abundances and the zone's composition set through
table look-ups\MarginPar{example? GCD?}.

In this paper, we look at some different approaches to coupling
hydrodynamics and reactions, using a helium detonation that attains
NSE as our testbed.  We use the \castro\ hydrodynamics code for all of
our numerical experiments, and all of the code to reproduce the results
in this paper are in the \castro\ github repository.

\section{Numerical Methodology}


We solve the Euler equations for compressible, reacting flow.  We'll focus on
one-dimensional flow, and the system appears as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \Uc_t}{\partial t}  + \frac{\partial \Fb^\xv (\Uc)}{\partial x} = \Sc(\Uc)
\end{equation}
where $\Uc = (\rho, (\rho X_k), (\rho u), (\rho E))^\intercal$ are
the conserved fluid quantities: mass density, $\rho$, velocity, $u$,
specific total energy, $E$, and nuclear
species mass fractions, $X_k$.  The specific total energy relates to
the specific internal energy as $E = e + u^2/2$.  The
corresponding fluxes are
\begin{equation}
\Fb^\xv (\Uc) = \left ( \begin{array}{c}
   \rho u \\ \rho X_k u \\ \rho u u + p \\  \rho u E + u p
   \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
Here the pressure, $p$, enters, and is found via the equation of state,
\begin{equation}
p = p(\rho, X_k, e)
\end{equation}

Finally, $\Sc(\Uc)$ are the source terms, which we decompose into
hydrodynamical sources, $\Hb$ (like gravity), and reactive sources,
$\Rb$,
\begin{equation}
  \Sc(\Uc) = \Hb(\Uc) + \Rb(\Uc)
\end{equation}
In this paper, we will not consider any hydrodynamical sources, but we
will carry the term $\Hb$ around for completeness.  The reactive
sources take the form:
\begin{equation}
  \Rb(\Uc) = \left ( \begin{array}{c}
     0 \\ \rho \omegadot_k \\ 0 \\ \rho \dot{S}
  \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
where $\omegadot_k$ is the creation rate for species $k$ and $\dot{S}$
is the energy generation rate per unit mass.

Sometimes it is preferable to work with the primitive variables,  $\qb
= (\rho, X_k, u, p, (\rho e))^\intercal$.  Here, the system appears
as:
\begin{equation}
\qb_t + \Ab^\xv(\qb) \qb_x  = \Sq
\end{equation}
with the matrix $\Ab^\xv$ giving the coefficients of the spatial derivatives
of the primitive variables:
\begin{equation}
\Ab^\xv(\qb) = \left ( \begin{array}{ccccc}
    u & 0 & \rho & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & u & 0    & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & u    & 1/\rho & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \Gamma_1 p & u & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \rho h & 0 & u
  \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_1$ is an adiabatic index, $\Gamma_1 = d\log p/d\log\rho
|_s$.  Note, the primitive state has two thermodynamic quantities, $p$
and $(\rho e)$, to more efficiently handle the general equation of
state in the Riemann solver, as described in \citet{castro}, but
alternate formulations are possible \citep{colellaglaz:1985}.
The source term vector, $\Sq$, can again be decomposed into hydrodynamic
sources (now in terms of the primitive variables) and reaction terms,
\begin{equation}
  \Sq = \Sqhydro + \Rb(q)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\Rb(q) = \left ( \begin{array}{c}
     0 \\
     \omegadot_k \\
     0 \\
     \Gamma_1 p \sigma \Sdot \\
     \rho \Sdot
   \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\sigma \equiv \frac{\partial p/\partial T |_\rho}{\rho c_p \partial p/\partial \rho |_T}
\end{equation}
and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, $c_p = \partial
h/\partial T |_p$.  A derivation of this source for the pressure
equation can be found in \cite{ABNZ:III}.  We note that this source is
algebraically identical to that shown in Eq.~25 of \cite{castro}.



We use the \castro\ hydrodynamics code~\cite{castro}, together with
the corner transport upwind piecewise parabolic method
hydrodynamics~\citep{millercolella:2002}.  This is a finite-volume
method that uses characteristic tracing to predict a time-centered
flux through the interfaces of the grid zones.  For pure
hydrodynamics, these time-centered fluxes result in second-order
accurate time integration.  With reactions, we want to couple
hydrodynamics and the reaction sources to second order.  Nuclear
reaction sources are stiff, and need to be integrated using implicit
methods for stabilty.  Operator splitting is traditionally employed
here, and our goal in this paper is to look at several different
approaches for splitting.

We describe several time-integration techniques for coupling
hydrodynamics and reactions in the next sections.


\subsection{Strang Splitting}


\subsection{Timestep Limiters and Retry Mechanism}

In addition to the standard CFL timestep limiter for explicit
hydrodynamics, \castro\ can also enforcing timestep limiters based on
the energy generation or abundance changes over a timestep.

\castro\ has the ability to reject a timestep if it detects a failure
and retry with smaller timesteps (subcycling to make up the original
required timestep).  Among the conditions that can trigger this are
density failing below zero during advection, the ODE integration
failing to converge in the implicit solve, or violation of one of the
timestep limiters during the step.  At the moment, this retry
mechanism only works with the CTU hydrodynamics + Strang splitting.
We enable it here, since, as will be shown shortly, this combination
of methods has the most difficulty in integrating the detonation.

\subsection{Balanced Splitting}

A variation on Strang splitting called (re-)balanced splitting was
developed in \citet{speth:2013}.

\subsection{Spectral Deferred Corrections}

The basic idea of spectral deferred corrections is break the timestep
into a number of temporal nodes and use low order difference methods
in a correction equation that, upon iteration, achieves a high-order
solution coupling the different physics together.


\subsection{Simplified-SDC Method}

A second-order accurate time integration method using a simple
deferred correction strategy was shown in \citep{SDC-old}.  A
version of this was also implemented in the \maestro\ low-Mach number
hydrodynamics code some time ago.  A compressible version, for use in
\castro\ is slightly different due to the need to do some operations
on the conserved variable state and some on the primitive variable
state.  We describe the application of this to the equations of
compressible hydrodynamics below:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\em Initialization}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Set the first iterate of the primitive-variable reactive source terms from the
    last step:
    \begin{equation}
      \Ic^{n+1/2,(0)}_{\qb} = \Ic^{n-1/2,(\smax)}_{\qb}
    \end{equation}
  %% \item Solve the Poisson problem for the initial gravitational potential:
  %%   \begin{equation}
  %%     \nabla^2 \Phi^n = 4\pi G \rho^n
  %%   \end{equation}

  %% \item Set the first guess at the new time potential as
  %%   $\Phi^{n+1,(0)} = \Phi^n$.

  \end{itemize}

\item {\em Iterate}

  Iterate from $k = 1, \ldots, \smax$.  For second-order accuracy,
  $\smax = 2$ is sufficient.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\em Create the Advective Update Term}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item convert $\Uc \rightarrow \qb$.  This is an algebraic transformation,
      but will require the EOS.

    \item predict $\qb$ to the interfaces at $n+1/2$ using the CTU PPM
      method.  The source terms, $\Sq$, used in the prediction are:
      \begin{equation}
        \Sq = \Sqhydro^{n+1/2} + \Ic_\qb^{n+1/2,(k-1)}
      \end{equation}
      Here we use the iteratively lagged integrals of the primitive variable
      terms accounting only for reactions, $\Ic_\qb^{n+1/2,(k-1)}$, as the
      reactive source.  Any hydrodynamic source terms are time-centered
      using the previous iteration:
      \begin{equation}
        \Sqhydro^{n+1/2} = \frac{1}{2} \left ( \Sqhydro^n + \Sqhydro^{n+1,(k-1)} \right )
      \end{equation}

    \item solve the Riemann problem at each interface to get a unique
      conserved state on each interface, $\Uc^{n+1/2}_{i+1/2}$

    \item construct the advective update terms, first ignoring the hydrodynamics sources:
      $\Advt{\Uc}^{n+1/2}_{i,j,k}$, e.g., as:
      \begin{align}
        \Advt{\Uc}^{n+1/2,(k)}_{i,j,k} =
          &- \frac{\Fb^\xv(\Uc^{n+1/2}_{i+1/2}) - \Fb^\xv(\Uc^{n+1/2}_{i-1/2})}{\Delta x} 
      \end{align}
    Now the conservative hydrodynamics source terms are computed by first updating to the
    new state with advection only\footnote{For a source like gravity, this update can be done first for $\rho$ and then define the new momentum source using $\rho^{\star\star}$ and likewise for energy}, as:
    \begin{equation}
      \Uc^{\star\star} = \Uc^n + \Delta t \Advt{\Uc}^{n+1/2,(k)}
    \end{equation}
    %% first updating the density to the new state with advection only as:
    %% \begin{equation}
    %%   \rho^{\star\star} = \rho^n + \Delta t \Advt{\rho}^{n+1/2,(k)}
    %% \end{equation}
    %% then constructing the momentum source term:
    %% \begin{equation}
    %%   {\bf S}_{\rho\Ub}^{n+1/2} = \frac{1}{2} (\rho^n \gb^n + \rho^{\star\star} \gb^{n+1,(k-1)})
    %% \end{equation}
    %% Then updating the momentum with only advection as:
    %% \begin{equation}
    %%   (\rho \Ub)^{\star\star} = (\rho \Ub)^n + \Delta t \Advt{\rho\Ub}^{n+1/2,(k)} + \Delta t {\bf S}_{\rho\Ub}^{n+1/2}
    %% \end{equation}
    %% and finally constructing the energy source:
    %% \begin{equation}
    %%   S_{\rho E}^{n+1/2} = \frac{1}{2} \left [ (\rho\Ub)^n \cdot \gb^n + (\rho\Ub)^{\star\star} \cdot \gb^{n+1,(k-1)}
    %%     \right ]
    %% \end{equation}

    The final advective update term is then:
    \begin{equation}
      \Adv{\Uc}^{n+1/2,(k)}_{i,j,k} = \Advt{\Uc}^{n+1/2,(k)}_{i,j,k} + \Shydro^{n+1/2}
    \end{equation}
    with
    \begin{equation}
      \Shydro^{n+1/2} = \left ( \begin{array}{c}
                     0 \\ 0 \\
                    {\bf S}_{\rho\Ub}^{n+1/2} \cdot \ex \\
                    S_{\rho E}^{n+1/2} \end{array} \right )
    \end{equation}

    \MarginPar{if $\Shydro$ depended on the outcome of the burn, we might need to do things differently here}

    \end{itemize}

  \item {\em Update the System Using a Method of Lines Integration}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Define the hydro source terms---these will be time-centered,
      but piecewise-constant in time throughout the integration.

    \item With the spatial discretization done, our system appears as a
      system of ODEs: \MarginPar{what is the right form of acceleration
        here? should we do piecewise linear in time?}
      \begin{equation}
        \left . \odt{\Uc} \right |_{i,j,k} = \Adv{\Uc}^{n+1/2,(k)}_{i,j,k} + \Rb(\Uc)
      \end{equation}

      As we are integrating this system we need to get the
      temperature, $T$, for the rate evaluations.  We construct this
      by subtracting the kinetic energy from the total energy to get
      the specific internal energy, $e$, and then calling the equation
      of state.

      Note that our advection terms are piecewise constant \MarginPar{need to think about this more}
      approximations, so when we integrate our system, their
      contributions will be linear in time.  Since $(\rho X_k)$ sees a
      linear advective term, $\rho$ does as well.  $(\rho \Ub)$ and
      $(\rho E)$ will also have linear contributions in time from
      advection.  We can see that the internal energy will also have a
      linear contribution by recognizing that the kinetic energy term,
      $K = (\rho |\Ub|^2)/\rho$ is linear in time.
      Since the reactions don't affect $\rho$ and $(\rho \Ub)$, we can
      algebraically update these using this piecewise linear behavior:
      \begin{align}
        \rho(t) &= \rho^n + \Adv{\rho}^{n+1/2,(k)} \, t \\
        (\rho \Ub)(t) &= (\rho \Ub)^n + \Adv{(\rho \Ub)}^{n+1/2,(k)} \, t
      \end{align}
      At the end of the integration, our new state is $\Uc^{n+1,(k)}$.

    \end{itemize}

  \item {\em Compute the Reactive Source Terms.}

    We now seek the $\Ic$'s that capture the effect of just the
    reaction sources on the state variables for the next iteration.
    For the conserved quantities, these would simply be: \MarginPar{fix signs on A}
    \begin{equation}
      \Ic^{(k)}_{\Uc} = \frac{\Uc^{n+1,(k)} - \Uc^n}{\Delta t} - \Adv{\Uc}^{n+1/2,(k)}
    \end{equation}
    However, for our primitive variables, which are used in the
    prediction, we need to construct the required source terms more
    carefully.  We want:
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:Iq}
      \Ic^{(k)}_{\qb} = \frac{\qb^{n+1,(k)} - \qb^n}{\Delta t} - \Adv{\qb}^{n+1/2,(k)}
    \end{equation}
    but we need the advective update for $\qb$, which we have not
    constructed.  Additionally, we cannot simply use the equation of
    state on $\Ic^{(k)}_{\Uc}$ since this is a time-derivative and
    does not represent a well-defined state in itself.  Instead, we
    derive $\Ic^{(k)}_{\qb}$ via a multi-step process.  We first find
    the conservative state as if it were updated only with advection:
    \begin{equation}
      \Uc^\star = \Uc^n + \Delta t \Adv{\Uc}^{n+1/2,(k)}
    \end{equation}
    and then construct the corresponding primitive variable state via an algebraic transform,
    $\Uc^\star \rightarrow \qb^\star$.
    This allows us to define the advective update for $\qb$ as:
    \begin{equation}
      \Adv{\qb}^{n+1/2,(k)} = \frac{\qb^\star - \qb^n}{\Delta t}
    \end{equation}
    Defining the primitive state corresponding to the fully-updated
    conserved state via an algebraic transform, $\Uc^{n+1,(k)}
    \rightarrow \qb^{n+1,(k)}$, we can construct $\Ic^{(k)}_{\qb}$ as given
    in Eq.~\ref{eq:Iq}.
    Putting all of this together, we see:
    \begin{equation}
      \Ic^{(k)}_{\qb} = \frac{\qb^{n+1,(k)} - \qb^\star}{\Delta t}
    \end{equation}



  %% \item {\em Solve for the New Gravitational Potential.}

  %%   We solve
  %%   \begin{equation}
  %%     \nabla^2 \Phi^{n+1,(k)} = 4\pi G \rho^{n+1,(k)}

\subsection{Detonations}

Our focus here is modeling helium detonations.  Previously, we
showed~\cite{katzzingale:2019} that accurate modeling the ignition of
a detonations requires a resolution such that $\tau_s < \tau_e$, where
$\tau_s = \Delta x/c_s$ is the sound crossing time of a zone and
$\tau_e = e/\dot{e}$ is the nuclear energy injection timescale.  For
the detonations explored here, we will work in that regime.

Helium detonations can be important in different models of Type Ia
supernova.  In the double detonation model for Type Ia supernovae, a
helium detonation is used to trigger a carbon detonation in the
underlying white dwarf.  White dwarf collisions or mergers can have
helium detonations if there is a thin layer of helium on the surface
of the white dwarfs.  We will model two densities, $2\times
10^6~\gcc$, e.g., as used in \citet{glasner:2018} for double
detonation models, and $10^7~\gcc$ to see the effects at higher
densities.

\appendix

\section{Jacobian}

To solve the reaction system implicitly, the ODE solver needs the Jacobian,
$\partial \Rb/\partial \Uc$.  We follow the method of \cite{castro_sdc}
and factor this into two pieces,
\begin{equation}
{\bf J} = \frac{\partial \Rb}{\partial {\bf w }} \frac{\partial {\bf w}}{\partial \Uc}
\end{equation}.

Even though it has no reactive sources, we include $\rho$ in our conservative state
for the purposes of computing the Jacobian (we denote the conserved state used for the
Jacobian $\Uc^\prime$.  
Writing this out for two species, $X_\alpha$ and $X_\beta$, we have
\begin{equation}
\Uc^\prime = \left ( \begin{array}{c} \rho \\ \rho X_\alpha \\ \rho X_\beta \\ \rho E \\ \rho e \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
We take the intermediate state to be ${\bf w} = (\rho, X_\alpha, X_\beta,
K, T)^\intercal$, where $K$ is the kinetic energy:
\begin{equation}
K = \frac{1}{2} |\Ub|^2
\end{equation}

The Jacobian transformation $\partial \Uc^\prime/\partial {\bf w}$ is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \Uc}{\partial {\bf w}} = \left (
   \begin{array}{ccccc}
       1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
       X_\alpha & \rho & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
       X_\beta & 0 & \rho & 0 & 0  \\
       \rho e_\rho  + e + K &
                 \rho  e_{X_\alpha} & \rho e_{X_\beta} & \rho &
                 \rho e_T \\
       \rho e_\rho  + e  &
                 \rho  e_{X_\alpha} & \rho e_{X_\beta} & 0 &
                 \rho e_T
     \end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
where we use the following notation for compactness:
\begin{equation}
e_\rho = \dedrd \qquad 
e_T = \dedTd \qquad
e_{X_k} = \dedXd 
\end{equation}
and write the kinetic energy as $K = |\Ub|^2/2$.  We get the inverse
(computed via SymPy, see the included Jupyter notebook) is:

\begin{equation}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\frac{\partial {\bf w}}{\partial \Uc^\prime} = \left (
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
   1  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   - \frac{X_\alpha}{\rho} & \frac{1}{\rho} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   - \frac{X_\beta}{\rho} & 0 & \frac{1}{\rho} & 0 & 0 \\
   - \frac{K}{\rho} & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{\rho} & -\frac{1}{\rho} \\
   \frac{\sum_k X_{k} e_{X_k} - \rho e_\rho - e}{ \rho e_T} &
    -\frac{e_{X_\alpha}}{\rho e_T} & -\frac{e_{X_\beta}}{\rho e_T} & 0 & \frac{1}{\rho e_T} \\
   \end{array}\right)
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
\end{equation}

The reaction vector is
\begin{equation}
\Rb(\Uc^\prime) = \left (  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \rho \omegadot_\alpha \\ \rho \omegadot_\beta \\ \rho \Sdot \\ \rho \Sdot \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
and the Jacobian is computed as $\partial \Rb/\partial {\bf w}$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \Rb}{\partial {\bf w}} = \left (
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
     0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     \omegadot_\alpha + \rho \frac{\partial \omegadot_\alpha}{\partial \rho} &
     \rho \frac{\partial \omegadot_\alpha}{\partial X_\alpha} &
     \rho \frac{\partial \omegadot_\alpha}{\partial X_\beta} & 0 & \rho \frac{\partial \omegadot_\alpha}{\partial T} \\
      %
     \omegadot_\beta + \rho \frac{\partial \omegadot_\beta}{\partial \rho} &
     \rho \frac{\partial \omegadot_\beta}{\partial X_\alpha} &
     \rho \frac{\partial \omegadot_\beta}{\partial X_\beta} & 0 &  \rho \frac{\partial \omegadot_\beta}{\partial T} \\
     %
     \Sdot + \rho \frac{\partial \Sdot}{\partial \rho} & \rho \frac{\partial \Sdot}{\partial X_\alpha} & \rho \frac{\partial \Sdot}{\partial X_\beta} & 0 & \rho \frac{\partial \Sdot}{\partial T} \\
     %
     \Sdot + \rho \frac{\partial \Sdot}{\partial \rho} & \rho \frac{\partial \Sdot}{\partial X_\alpha} & \rho \frac{\partial \Sdot}{\partial X_\beta} & 0 & \rho \frac{\partial \Sdot}{\partial T} \\
  \end{array}
  \right )
\end{equation}
