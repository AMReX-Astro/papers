1. In equation (1), detailed forms about the conserved vector U, the
advection terms A() and the reaction terms R() may be needed for
potential readers who are not familiar with radiation hydrodynamics
simulations.

  We've added the explicit form of each of these terms into the text.


2. In equation (2), the dt m term, which is not defined in the
following paragraph – is that simply t m+1 – t m , or is it the
advection time scale?

  It is just the difference between time nodes.  I've made that explicit
  in the text now.

3. Although the details are included in [2], it may be still useful to
include more details about getting equation (3) from (2) (or provide
more references of deriving equation 3?), which is the main part of
the numerical algorithm implemented in the new development.

   A new paragraph has been added motivating this equation along
   with some references.  The reference to the Castro SDC paper
   has also been updated.

4. The authors mention in the manuscript that the code achieves
expected convergence (either second-order or fourth-order) on a wide
variety of problems. Although the details are included in [2] as well,
it may be useful for readers to understand the quality of the
solutions by adding one figure or one table demonstrating the
convergence of test simulations.

   A table was added summarizing the covergence from the main paper
   showing the results.

5. Section 4 – is it possible (within the page limit?) to include at
least one figure to show the results from the test problem described
in the simulation.

   A reference to the Eiden et al paper has been added.
