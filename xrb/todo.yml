- Author Block:
    - Yuri's at Southhampton now?

- Introduction:
    - Need some references
    - Need Yuri's input on his papers
    - Need to summarize the Astronum '18 paper

- Flame Properties:
    - Make axis labels on 1D speed plots larger
    - What is Table XX? Was it the original 1D flame table, and should we include it if so?
    
- Initial Model:
    - Next to "we compute T(y) and (ρe)(y) from the equation of state", it says show. Should we
        include an equation for that? There is a plot showing ρ and T as functions of y (Figure 3).
    
- The "Simulation and Results" section needs work:
    
    - The introductory part is bulleted
    
    - General Features:
        - Figure 4 (Abar) needs a description
        - Discuss the hurricane in the z-velocity plots
        - Talk about the instability at the top, noise at the bottom?
        
    - Flame Acceleration:
        - Need to standardize the names of the runs
        - Need to thicken the line for the standard run in the speed plot
        - Change axis and legend fonts on 2D speed plot
        
    - Boosting:
        - Need to write, currently just two sentences
        
    - Entrainment, Flow Features:
        - Add a streamline plot
        - Reinterpret the phase plots?
        
    - Rotation Rate:
        - We started it further from the axis
        - Discuss the effect on the flame speed
        
    - Reaction Network:
        - Flame speed and energy generation drop by a small factor
        - Abar plots show much slower development
        
    - Resolution:
        - There is effectively no change in flame speed
        - Are there other quantities we want to look at?
        
- So does the "Discussion" section:
    - Turn bullet points into a few paragraphs
    - These studies complement the _
    - Talk more about mixed bursts and 3D, and write about MHD and radiation transport
    
- Appendix:
    - Write about the diffusion tests?
