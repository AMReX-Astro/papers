- It would be very helpful if the authors described in detail how their study and results compare
  with and compliment those previous studies (series of papers by Cavecchi et al.):
  
    We've added a paragraph to the introduction describing the approximations made by Cavecchi et
    al. and how our study compares in those areas.
    
- p. 2: "they can help understand" sounds a bit strange:

    We've changed it to "they can help us to understand".
    
- p. 8: T_{lo} does not seem to be explicitly defined:

    We've added a sentence describing T_{lo} to the paragraph after eq. 19.
    
- p. 13: ...ahead of the hottest part of the flame...:

    We've changed "ahead" to "to the right".
    
- The description of the coordinate system is a bit confusing:

    **Still need to address this**
    
We also have some additional data (out to 12.6 ms) from the 1000 Hz run that wasn't included when
calculating the flame speed. We've updated the flame speed plot and table to include the new data.
