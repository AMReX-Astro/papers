% Introduction
%======================================================================
\section{Introduction}\label{Sec:Introduction}

Unlike our previous paper, all runs are now conducted without artificially boosting the speed of the flame in order to reduce the computational cost. This is possible because of the work done to offload the code to GPUs, where it runs significantly faster. We can therefore run the tests without any boosting. 


We investigate the effect of rotation rate on the flame. With the exception of (citation to the weird 11 Hz flame), most observations of XRBs come from sources with rotation rates of 200-600Hz \citep{bilous:2019,galloway:2020} \MarginPar{check whether this is true for XRBs or just burst oscillations}. There are a number of factors that could explain this lack of observations below 200 Hz. It could be that there is some physical process which inhibits the flame ignition and/or spread at lower rotation rates. It could be that burst oscillations at lower rotation rates are smaller in amplitude and therefore more difficult to detect. It could be that it's not got anything to do with the flame at all, but that neutron stars in accreting low mass X-ray binaries rarely have rotation rates below 200 Hz \MarginPar{look into this?}. 
 
Previous studies have found that rotation can have a significant affect on the flame's propagation. As the rotation rate increases, the Coriolis force whips the spreading flame up into a hurricane-like structure \citep{spitkovsky2002,cavecchi:2013}. The stronger Coriolis force leads to greater confinement of the hot accreted matter, leading to easier ignition of the flame \citep{art-2015-cavecchi-etal}. 

Previous work has predicted that crustal heating is stronger a lower accretion rates and weaker at higher accretion rates, due to the effect of neutrino losses \citep{Cumming2006,johnston:2019}. In our models, we keep the crust at a constant temperature, so by increasing this temperature we can effectively increase the crustal heating and mimic the effects of lower accretion rates. A shallow heating mechanism of as yet unknown origin has been found necessary to reproduce observed properties of XRBs \citep{Deibel2015,Turlione2015,Keek2017}.

In the following sections, we conduct a series of simulations at various rotation rates to investigate its effect on the flame. We find that at lower rotation rates, the flame itself becomes harder to ignite. We discuss the implications that this may have for burst physics and observations.

% Numerical Approach
%======================================================================
\section{Numerical Approach}\label{Sec:numerics}

We use the Castro hydrodynamics code \citep{castro} and the simulation framework introduced in \citet{flame_wave1}.
The main difference is that we no longer boost the flames by adjusting
the reaction rates and conductivities.  By porting \castro\ to GPUs,
we are able to run the unboosted flame simulations with fewer
resources than the boosted simulations used in our earlier paper.

We add the geometric source terms from \citet{bernard-champmartin}

\section{Simulations and Results}\label{Sec:results}


Things to show:

\begin{figure}[t]

\centering
\plotone{time_series_1000}
\caption{\label{fig:time_series_1000} Time series of the 1000 Hz run showing $\bar{A}$.}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:time_series_500} and \ref{fig:time_series_1000} show
time series of the mean molecular weight for the 500~Hz and 1000~Hz
runs.  Compared to those in \cite{flame_wave1}, ashes behind the flame
do not reach as high atomic weights.  This is not surprising, since
those early runs boosted the reaction rates.  Comparing these two new
runs, we see that the burning is much more evolved for the higher
rotation rate.  We believe that this is because the rotation confines
the initial perturbation and subsequent expansion from the burning
better, allowing the reactions to progress further.

MZ: lateral profiles of X vs distance behind the flame; 
vertical profiles of the atmosphere behind the flame---how does it compare to isentropic?

different rotation rates 

shape of flame, amount of mixing (e.g. it looks like slower rotation rates have less mixed flames as the hurricane is less strong.)

Don: look at ratio of enuc to e?

Figure~\ref{fig:flame_speeds} shows the position of the flame as a
function of time.  Defining the position is difficult, so we \MarginPar{need explanation here}

	\plottwo{speeds_1_100th_max.pdf}{speeds_1_1000th_max.pdf}

\end{figure}

Looking at the phase plots in Figures~\ref{fig:urho}-\ref{fig:abar}, we see:
\begin{itemize}
    \item From the $u$-$\rho$ and $u$-$v$ plots, we see that the burning occurs in a region of high density where the fluid is moving in a circular motion. From the previous plots (see: streamlines?), this most likely corresponds to the leading edge of the flame. This feature is not (yet?) developed in the 250~Hz flame. (will this ever develop, or will it just fizzle out completely?)
    \item From the $\bar{A}$-$T$ plots in Figure \ref{fig:abar}, we can see that as the rotation rate increases, so does the peak temperature. We believe that the tracks in the plot correspond to reaction pathways in the reaction network. In the 1000~Hz plot, these tracks are somewhat disrupted, possibly due to the more vigorous mixing of the vortex at the flame front. (If this continues or if the rotation was cranked even higher, would the reactions get so disrupted that the burning is snuffed out, similar to what happens in combustion when the turbulent vortices become so small they penetrate the reaction zone and completely disrupt it?)
\end{itemize}
