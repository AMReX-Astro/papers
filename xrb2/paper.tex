% Introduction
%======================================================================
\section{Introduction}\label{Sec:Introduction}

Unlike our previous paper, all runs are now conducted without artificially boosting the speed of the flame in order to reduce the computational cost. This is possible because of the work done to offload the code to GPUs, where it runs significantly faster. We can therefore run the tests without any boosting. 


We investigate the effect of rotation rate on the flame. With the exception of (citation to the weird 11 Hz flame), most observations of XRBs come from sources with rotation rates of 200-600Hz \citep{bilous:2019,galloway:2020} \MarginPar{check whether this is true for XRBs or just burst oscillations}. There are a number of factors that could explain this lack of observations below 200 Hz. It could be that there is some physical process which inhibits the flame ignition and/or spread at lower rotation rates. It could be that burst oscillations at lower rotation rates are smaller in amplitude and therefore more difficult to detect. It could be that it's not got anything to do with the flame at all, but that neutron stars in accreting low mass X-ray binaries rarely have rotation rates below 200 Hz \MarginPar{look into this?}. 
 
Previous studies have found that rotation can have a significant affect on the flame's propagation. As the rotation rate increases, the Coriolis force whips the spreading flame up into a hurricane-like structure \citep{spitkovsky2002,cavecchi:2013}. The stronger Coriolis force leads to greater confinement of the hot accreted matter, leading to easier ignition of the flame \citep{art-2015-cavecchi-etal}. 

Previous work has predicted that crustal heating is stronger a lower accretion rates and weaker at higher accretion rates, due to the effect of neutrino losses \citep{Cumming2006,johnston:2019}. In our models, we keep the crust at a constant temperature, so by increasing this temperature we can effectively increase the crustal heating and mimic the effects of lower accretion rates. A shallow heating mechanism of as yet unknown origin has been found necessary to reproduce observed properties of XRBs \citep{Deibel2015,Turlione2015,Keek2017}.

In the following sections, we conduct a series of simulations at various rotation rates to investigate its effect on the flame. We find that at lower rotation rates, the flame itself becomes harder to ignite. We discuss the implications that this may have for burst physics and observations.

% Numerical Approach
%======================================================================
\section{Numerical Approach}\label{Sec:numerics}
\MarginPar{mz}

We use the Castro hydrodynamics code \citep{castro} and the simulation
framework introduced in \citet{flame_wave1}.  The main difference is
that we no longer boost the flames by adjusting the reaction rates and
conductivities.  By porting \castro\ to GPUs \citep{castro:sc20}, we
are able to run the unboosted flame simulations with fewer resources
than the boosted simulations used in our earlier paper.  For these
axisymmetric simulations, we adding a missing geometric source terms
from \citet{bernard-champmartin} that captures the effects of the
divergence of the flux operating on the azimuthal unit vector.  This
term is a small correction, but was missing from our earlier
simulations.

The initial model is setup in the same fashion as described in
\citet{flame_wave}.  In particular, we create a ``hot'' and ``cool''
hydrostatic model representing the ash and fuel states and blend the
two models laterally to create a hot region near the origin of
coordinates and a smooth transition to the cooler region at larger
radii.  In the calculations presented here, we explore the structure
of the initial models by varying some of the parameters, in particular, the temperature
of the neutron star and at the base of the fuel layer. \MarginPar{add plot showing models}

Figures~\ref{fig:time_series_500} and \ref{fig:time_series_1000} show
time series of the mean molecular weight for the 500~Hz and 1000~Hz
runs.  Compared to those in \cite{flame_wave1}, ashes behind the flame
do not reach as high atomic weights.  This is not surprising, since
those early runs boosted the reaction rates.  Comparing these two new
runs, we see that the burning is much more evolved for the higher
rotation rate.  We believe that this is because the rotation confines
the initial perturbation and subsequent expansion from the burning
better, allowing the reactions to progress further.

different rotation rates. 250 Hz failed to ignite, could indicate that another source of confinement (e.g.\ magnetic fields) would need to take
over at lower rotation rates to allow a burst to occur, at least for our current initial model. We've seen that increasing rotation rate can
increase nuclear reaction rate already

Don: look at ratio of enuc to e?

\subsection{Effect of Rotation Rate on Flame Propagation}\label{ssec:rot_propagation}

For the purpose of measuring the flame propagation speed and acceleration, we track the position of each of our flames
as a function of time. We define the position in terms of a particular $\enucdot$ value, as we did in \citet{flame_wave1}.
To recapitulate: we first reduce the 2D $\enucdot$ data for each simulation run to a set of 1D radial profiles by averaging
over the vertical coordinate. After averaging, we take our reference $\enucdot$ value to be some fraction of the global $\enucdot$
maximum across all of these profiles. Since the flames in our simulations propagate rightward, we then search the region of
each profile to the right of the local $\enucdot$ maximum for the point where the $\enucdot$ first drops below this reference
value. This point gives us the location of our flame front.

In \citet{flame_wave1}, we used $0.1\%$ of the global $\enucdot$ maximum for our reference value. For the high temperature
unboosted flames, however, we found that the $\enucdot$ profiles failed to reach that small a value across the domain at most times,
which prevented us from getting reliable position measurements. We therefore use $1\%$ of the global $\enucdot$ maximum in this paper
rather than $0.1\%$. This is still sufficiently small that our measurements are not overly sensitive to turbulence and other local fluid
motions (the issue with simply tracking the local maximum), but allows us to avoid the pitfall encountered by the $0.1\%$ metric.

	%
\end{deluxetable}

Figure~\ref{fig:flame_speeds_1} gives position vs.\ time for the $\tt{F500}$ and $\tt{F1000}$ runs to show the dependence on rotation rate. As some of the hotter 500~Hz runs exhibit significant accelerations, we fit a quadratic curve to each set of data and calculate the acceleration and initial velocity from the fit parameters. These results are given in Table~\ref{table:flame_speeds}.

We found in \citet{flame_wave1} that the flame speed $s$ obeys:
\begin{equation}
	s \appropto L_R (\epsdot)^{\half} \propto \frac{(\epsdot)^{\half}}{\Omega}
\end{equation}
where $\epsdot$ is the specific energy generation rate and $L_R$ is the Rossby length. This was consistent with the results of
\citet{cavecchi:2013}, who noted that the flame speeds in their simulations scaled with the Rossby length. As seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:flame_speeds_1}, there is no obvious inverse scaling with rotation rate in this set of runs. We observed earlier,
however, that nuclear reactions progress more quickly at the higher rotation rate. This results in a higher $\enucdot$ --- up to 4
to 6 times higher near the burning front after the flame ignites --- which may counteract the reduction in flame speed from the
increased Coriolis confinement. We also observe that the 500 Hz run accelerates faster than the 1000 Hz run, which appears to experience a
small deceleration at early times. \MarginPar{This is speculation on my part -- does someone else have clear idea why?} This disparity
may be a direct result of the difference in Coriolis force. It could also be due to the 500 Hz flame taking more time to develop fully
and reach higher burning rates, resulting in an $\epsdot$ increase over time.

% It might be worth plotting peak enucdot as a function of time for each run

Looking at the phase plots in Figures~\ref{fig:urho}-\ref{fig:abar}, we see:
\begin{itemize}
    \item From the $u$-$\rho$ and $u$-$v$ plots, we see that the burning occurs in a region of high density where the fluid is moving in a circular motion. From the previous plots (see: streamlines?), this most likely corresponds to the leading edge of the flame. This feature is not (yet?) developed in the 250~Hz flame. (will this ever develop, or will it just fizzle out completely?)
    \item From the $\bar{A}$-$T$ plots in Figure \ref{fig:abar}, we can see that as the rotation rate increases, so does the peak temperature. We believe that the tracks in the plot correspond to reaction pathways in the reaction network. In the 1000~Hz plot, these tracks are somewhat disrupted, possibly due to the more vigorous mixing of the vortex at the flame front. (If this continues or if the rotation was cranked even higher, would the reactions get so disrupted that the burning is snuffed out, similar to what happens in combustion when the turbulent vortices become so small they penetrate the reaction zone and completely disrupt it?)

\end{figure}
    

\subsection{Effect of Temperature Structure}\label{ssec:temp_structure}

To explore the effect of different initial temperature configurations, we run four simulations fixed at a rotation rate of 500 Hz with temperatures as shown in Table \ref{table:500Hz_runs}. For all the 500 Hz simulations (with the exception of the coolest run, $\tt{F500}$), we set $T_\mathrm{star}$ = $T_\mathrm{hi}$, scaling $\delta T$ accordingly to maintain a consistent value of $T_\mathrm{hi} + \delta T$. If we let $T_\mathrm{star} < T_\mathrm{hi}$, the cooler neutron star surface might act as a heat sink and siphon away energy that would otherwise go into heating the burning layer.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\plotone{compare_500Hz_abar}
\caption{\label{fig:compare_500Hz_abar} Comparison of $\bar{A}$ for 3 different 500~Hz models with different neutron star temperatures, $T_\star$, and resulting envelope structures. } %This will be updated to show at 70ms
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:compare_500Hz_abar} shows 3 different 500 Hz simulations with different initial temperature structures. The hottest of the three models, $\tt{F500\_3E8}$, has a faster propagating flame. It also appears to have a secondary burning region above the neutron star atmosphere layer (the atmosphere edge is located at $\sim 1.2\times 10^4$ cm). It is likely that a small amount of hot material broke through the top of the atmosphere.

{\color{red} On the subject of things breaking out of the atmosphere, discuss interesting characteristics of the extreme 4E8 run here: maybe include a plot showing enuc at 40 ms comapared to one of the cooler runs, and another plot showing the momentum components? Seems like the flame moves very quickly across the domain, and then residual burning after the flame has passed eventually ignites the entire fuel layer. This total ignition can also occur in nature for a neutron star with a lot of dense and hot accreted material.}

		for $t \gtrsim 0.02~\mathrm{s}$.}
\end{figure}

The method for measuring flame propagation described in Section \ref{ssec:rot_propagation} is applied in Figure \ref{fig:flame_speeds_2} to the three 500 Hz runs with $T_{\mathrm{star}} \leq 3 \times 10^8~\mathrm{K}$. As the initial $T_{\mathrm{star}}$ is increased, the flame becomes greatly accelerated. The initial flame velocities and accelerations derived from a quadratic least-squares fit to each of the datasets are provided in Table \ref{table:flame_speeds}. The reason for the acceleration of the flame over time is not entirely clear. It could be that energy released from burning begins to dominate the flame's propagation as it evolves, increasing the flame speed over time. Another possibility is that the increased temperatures lead to enhanced turbulent mixing effects that pull in more fresh fuel for the flame to burn. Yet another possibility is that the higher initial $T_{\mathrm{star}}$ leads to a greater average temperature in the fuel layer over time, making it easier for the flame to burn the fuel and propagate.

Looking at the phase plots in Figures~\ref{fig:urho_hot}-\ref{fig:abar_hot}, we see:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The $u$-$\rho$ plot in Figure~\ref{fig:urho_hot} shows that the horizontal velocity when $T_{\rm star} = 3\times10^8$~K is sufficiently greater than for the two cooler runs. This is consistent with the plot of the flame front position, where we saw that the hottest flame was significantly faster at later times than the cooler flames.
    \item The $u$-$v$ plot in Figure~\ref{fig:uv_hot} further demonstrates this, as again we see that the magnitude of the velocity of the flame for the hottest run is significantly larger. Also of interest in these plots is that the coolest run does not seem to have developed the characteristic vortex structure at the burning front (i.e. where $\dot{e}_{\rm nuc}$ is greatest) that can be clearly seen for the hotter runs.
    \item The $\overline{A}$-$T$ plot in Figure~\ref{fig:abar_hot} suggests that the actual reactions happening in the hottest run may be different than for the cooler runs. Not only is the flame itself significantly hotter overall, but there is a large causally connected region across a wide range of $\overline{A}$. This indicates that the hotter temperature has facilitated significant burning in reaction pathways that were not favored at the lower temperatures.
