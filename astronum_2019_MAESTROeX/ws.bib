@article{Miczek2014,
abstract = {Many problems in stellar astrophysics feature flows at low Mach numbers. Conventional compressible hydrodynamics schemes frequently used in the field have been developed for the transonic regime and exhibit excessive numerical dissipation for these flows. While schemes were proposed that solve hydrodynamics strictly in the low Mach regime and thus restrict their applicability, we aim at developing a scheme that correctly operates in a wide range of Mach numbers. Based on an analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the Euler equations in the low Mach limit we propose a novel scheme that is able to maintain a low Mach number flow setup while retaining all effects of compressibility. This is achieved by a suitable modification of the well-known Roe solver. Numerical tests demonstrate the capability of this new scheme to reproduce slow flow structures even in moderate numerical resolution. Our scheme provides a promising approach to a consistent multidimensional hydrodynamical treatment of astrophysical low Mach number problems such as convection, instabilities, and mixing in stellar evolution.},

We include the subadiabatic part of the tachocline and show that this, in conjunction with turbulent heat conductivity within the convection zone and overshoot region, provides the key physics to break the Taylor-Proudman constraint, which dictates differential rotation with contour lines parallel to the axis of rotation in case of an isentropic stratification. We show that differential rotation with contour lines inclined by 10°-30° with respect to the axis of rotation is a robust result of the model, which does not depend on the details of the Reynolds stress and the assumed viscosity, as long as the Reynolds stress transports angular momentum toward the equator. The meridional flow is more sensitive with respect to the details of the assumed Reynolds stress, but a flow cell, equatorward at the base of the convection zone and poleward in the upper half of the convection zone, is the preferred flow pattern.},

@article{Hotta2012,
abstract = {Context. The anelastic approximation is often adopted in numerical calculation with low Mach number, such as stellar internal convection. This approximation requires frequent global communication, because of an elliptic partial differential equation. Frequent global communication is negative factor for the parallel computing with a large number of CPUs. Aims. The main purpose of this paper is to test the validity of a method that artificially reduces the speed of sound for the compressible fluid equations in the context of stellar internal convection. The reduction of speed of sound allows for larger time steps in spite of low Mach number, while the numerical scheme remains fully explicit and the mathematical system is hyperbolic and thus does not require frequent global communication. Methods. Two and three dimensional compressible hydrodynamic equations are solved numerically. Some statistical quantities of solutions computed with different effective Mach numbers (due to reduction of speed of sound) are compared to test the validity of our approach. Results. Numerical simulations with artificially reduced speed of sound are a valid approach as long as the effective Mach number (based on the reduced speed of sound) remains less than 0.7.},

Since most of the interesting physics in a Type Ia supernova transpires at Mach numbers from 0.01 to 0.1, such an approach enables both a considerable increase in accuracy and a savings in computer time compared with frequently used compressible codes. Our equation set is derived from the fully compressible equations using low Mach number asymptotics, but without any restriction on the size of perturbations in density or temperature. Comparisons with simulations that use the fully compressible equations validate the low Mach number model in regimes where both are applicable. Comparisons to simulations based on the more traditional anelastic approximation also demonstrate the agreement of these models in the regime for which the anelastic approximation is valid. For low Mach number flows with potentially finite amplitude variations in density and temperature, the low Mach number model overcomes the limitations of each of the more traditional models and can serve as the basis for an accurate and efficient simulation tool.},

abstract = {Many astrophysical phenomena are highly subsonic, requiring specialized numerical methods suitable
 for long-time integration. In a series of earlier papers we described the development of MAESTRO , a
 low Mach number stellar hydrodynamics code that can be used to simulate long-time, low-speed flows
 that would be prohibitively expensive to model using traditional compressible codes. MAESTRO is
 based on an equation set derived using low Mach number asymptotics; this equation set does not
 explicitly track acoustic waves and thus allows a significant increase in the time step. MAESTRO is
 suitable for two- and three-dimensional local atmospheric flows as well as three-dimensional
 full-star flows. Here, we continue the development of MAESTRO by incorporating adaptive mesh
 refinement (AMR). The primary difference between MAESTRO and other structured grid AMR approaches
 for incompressible and low Mach number flows is the presence of the time-dependent base state, whose
 evolution is coupled to the evolution of the full solution. We also describe how to incorporate the
 expansion of the base state for full-star flows, which involves a novel mapping technique between
 the one-dimensional base state and the Cartesian grid, as well as a number of overall improvements
 to the algorithm. We examine the efficiency and accuracy of our adaptive code, and demonstrate that
 it is suitable for further study of our initial scientific application, the convective phase of
 Type Ia supernovae.},
