abstract = {We present MAESTROeX, a massively parallel solver for low Mach number astrophysical flows. The underlying low Mach number equation set allows for efficient, long-time integration for highly subsonic flows compared to compressible approaches. MAESTROeX is suitable for modeling full spherical stars as well as well as planar simulations of dynamics within localized regions of a star, and can robustly handle several orders of magnitude of density and pressure stratification. Previously, we have described the development of the predecessor of MAESTROeX, called MAESTRO, in a series of papers. Here, we present a new, greatly simplified temporal integration scheme that retains the same order of accuracy as our previous approaches. We also explore the use of alternative spatial mapping of the one-dimensional base state onto the full Cartesian grid. The code leverages the new AMReX software framework for block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) applications, allowing for scalability to large fractions of leadership-class machines. Using our previous studies on the convective phase of single-degenerate progenitor models of Type Ia supernovae as a guide, we characterize the performance of the code and validate the new algorithmic features. Like MAESTRO, MAESTROeX is fully open source.},

abstract = {Simulations in stellar astrophysics involve the coupling of hydrodynamics and nuclear reactions under a wide variety of conditions, from simmering convective flows to explosive nucleosynthesis. Numerical techniques such as operator splitting (most notably Strang splitting) are usually employed to couple the physical processes, but this can affect the accuracy of the simulation, particularly when the burning is vigorous. Furthermore, Strang splitting does not have a straightforward extension to higher-order integration in time. We present a new temporal integration strategy based on spectral deferred corrections and describe the second- and fourth-order implementations in the open-source, finite-volume, compressible hydrodynamics code Castro. One notable advantage to these schemes is that they combine standard low-order discretizations for individual physical processes in a way that achieves an arbitrarily high order of accuracy. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of the new methods on several test problems of increasing complexity.},

abstract = {Many problems in stellar astrophysics feature flows at low Mach numbers. Conventional compressible hydrodynamics schemes frequently used in the field have been developed for the transonic regime and exhibit excessive numerical dissipation for these flows. While schemes were proposed that solve hydrodynamics strictly in the low Mach regime and thus restrict their applicability, we aim at developing a scheme that correctly operates in a wide range of Mach numbers. Based on an analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the Euler equations in the low Mach limit we propose a novel scheme that is able to maintain a low Mach number flow setup while retaining all effects of compressibility. This is achieved by a suitable modification of the well-known Roe solver. Numerical tests demonstrate the capability of this new scheme to reproduce slow flow structures even in moderate numerical resolution. Our scheme provides a promising approach to a consistent multidimensional hydrodynamical treatment of astrophysical low Mach number problems such as convection, instabilities, and mixing in stellar evolution.},

We show that differential rotation with contour lines inclined by 10°-30° with respect to the axis of rotation is a robust result of the model, which does not depend on the details of the Reynolds stress and the assumed viscosity, as long as the Reynolds stress transports angular momentum toward the equator. The meridional flow is more sensitive with respect to the details of the assumed Reynolds stress, but a flow cell, equatorward at the base of the convection zone and poleward in the upper half of the convection zone, is the preferred flow pattern.},

abstract = {Context. The anelastic approximation is often adopted in numerical calculation with low Mach number, such as stellar internal convection. This approximation requires frequent global communication, because of an elliptic partial differential equation. Frequent global communication is negative factor for the parallel computing with a large number of CPUs. Aims. The main purpose of this paper is to test the validity of a method that artificially reduces the speed of sound for the compressible fluid equations in the context of stellar internal convection. The reduction of speed of sound allows for larger time steps in spite of low Mach number, while the numerical scheme remains fully explicit and the mathematical system is hyperbolic and thus does not require frequent global communication. Methods. Two and three dimensional compressible hydrodynamic equations are solved numerically. Some statistical quantities of solutions computed with different effective Mach numbers (due to reduction of speed of sound) are compared to test the validity of our approach. Results. Numerical simulations with artificially reduced speed of sound are a valid approach as long as the effective Mach number (based on the reduced speed of sound) remains less than 0.7.},

 low Mach number stellar hydrodynamics code that can be used to simulate long-time, low-speed flows
 that would be prohibitively expensive to model using traditional compressible codes. MAESTRO is
 based on an equation set derived using low Mach number asymptotics; this equation set does not
 explicitly track acoustic waves and thus allows a significant increase in the time step. MAESTRO is
 suitable for two- and three-dimensional local atmospheric flows as well as three-dimensional
 full-star flows. Here, we continue the development of MAESTRO by incorporating adaptive mesh
 refinement (AMR). The primary difference between MAESTRO and other structured grid AMR approaches
 for incompressible and low Mach number flows is the presence of the time-dependent base state, whose
 evolution is coupled to the evolution of the full solution. We also describe how to incorporate the
 expansion of the base state for full-star flows, which involves a novel mapping technique between
 the one-dimensional base state and the Cartesian grid, as well as a number of overall improvements
 to the algorithm. We examine the efficiency and accuracy of our adaptive code, and demonstrate that
 it is suitable for further study of our initial scientific application, the convective phase of

abstract = {This paper describes the first steps of development of a new multidimensional time implicit code devoted to the study of hydrodynamical processes in stellar interiors. The code solves the hydrodynamical equations in spherical geometry and is based on the finite volume method. Radiation transport is taken into account within the diffusion approximation. Realistic equation of state and opacities are implemented, allowing the study of a wide range of problems characteristic of stellar interiors. We describe in details the numerical method and various standard tests performed to validate the method. We present preliminary results devoted to the description of stellar convection. We first perform a local simulation of convection in the surface layers of a A-type star model. This simulation is used to test the ability of the code to address stellar conditions and to validate our results, since they can be compared to similar previous simulations based on explicit codes. We then present a global simulation of turbulent convective motions in a cold giant envelope, covering 80{\%} in radius of the stellar structure. Although our implicit scheme is unconditionally stable, we show that in practice there is a limitation on the time step which prevent the flow to move over several cells during a time step. Nevertheless, in the cold giant model we reach a hydro CFL number of 100. We also show that we are able to address flows with a wide range of Mach numbers (10{\^{}}-3 {\textless} Ms{\textless} 0.5), which is impossible with an anelastic approach. Our first developments are meant to demonstrate that the use of an implicit scheme applied to a stellar evolution context is perfectly thinkable and to provide useful guidelines to optimise the development of an implicit multi-D hydrodynamical code.},

abstract = {We present the results of a numerical benchmark study for the MUlti-dimensional Stellar Implicit Code (MUSIC) based on widely applicable two- and three-dimensional compressible hydrodynamics problems relevant to stellar interiors. MUSIC is an implicit large eddy simulation code that uses implicit time integration, implemented as a Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method. A physics based preconditioning technique which can be adjusted to target varying physics is used to improve the performance of the solver. The problems used for this benchmark study include the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and the decay of the Taylor-Green vortex. Additionally we show a test of hydrostatic equilibrium, in a stellar environment which is dominated by radiative effects. In this setting the flexibility of the preconditioning technique is demonstrated. This work aims to bridge the gap between the hydrodynamic test problems typically used during development of numerical methods and the complex flows of stellar interiors. A series of multi-dimensional tests are performed and analysed. Each of these test cases is analysed with a simple, scalar diagnostic, with the aim of enabling direct code comparisons. As the tests performed do not have analytic solutions we verify MUSIC by comparing to established codes including ATHENA and the PENCIL code. MUSIC is able to both reproduce behaviour from established and widely-used codes as well as results expected from theoretical predictions. This benchmarking study concludes a series of papers describing the development of the MUSIC code and provides confidence in the future applications.},

@article{Nonaka2011,
abstract = {We extend our previous three-dimensional, full-star simulations of the final hours of convection preceding ignition in Type Ia supernovae to higher resolution using the adaptive mesh refinement capability of our low Mach number code, MAESTRO. We report the statistics of the ignition of the first flame at an effective 4.34 km resolution, and general flow field properties at an effective 2.17 km resolution. We find that off-center ignition is likely, with radius of 50 km most favored and a likely range of 40 to 75 km. This is consistent with our previous coarser (8.68 km resolution) simulations, implying that we have achieved sufficient resolution in our determination of likely ignition radii. The dynamics of the last few hot spots preceding ignition suggest that a multiple ignition scenario is not likely. With improved resolution, we can more clearly see the general flow pattern in the convective region, characterized by a strong outward plume with a lower speed recirculation. We show that the convective core is turbulent with a Kolmogorov spectrum and has a lower turbulent intensity and larger integral length scale than previously thought (on the order of 16 km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} and 200 km, respectively), and we discuss the potential consequences for the first flames.},

@article{Malone2014a,
abstract = {We present high-resolution, full-star simulations of the post-ignition phase of Type Ia supernovae using the compressible hydrodynamics code Castro. Initial conditions, including the turbulent velocity field and ignition site, are imported directly from a simulation of the last few hours of presupernova convection using a low Mach number code, Maestro. Adaptive mesh refinement allows the initial burning front to be modeled with an effective resolution of 36,8643 zones (136 m zone–1). The initial rise and expansion of the deflagration front are tracked until burning reaches the star's edge and the role of the background turbulence on the flame is investigated. The effect of artificially moving the ignition location closer to the star's center is explored. The degree to which turbulence affects the burning front decreases with increasing ignition radius since the buoyancy force is stronger at larger radii. Even central ignition—in the presence of a background convective flow field—is rapidly carried off-center as the flame is carried by the flow field. We compare our results to analytic models for burning thermals, and find that they reproduce the general trends of the bubble's size and mass, but underpredict the amount of buoyant acceleration due to simplifying assumptions of the bubble's properties. Overall, we find that the amount of mass that burns prior to flame break out is small, consistent with a "gravitationally confined detonation" occurring at a later epoch, but additional burning will occur following breakout that may modify this conclusion.},

We explore these convection dynamics for a range of white dwarf core and helium shell masses in three dimensions using the low Mach number hydrodynamics code Maestro. We present calculations of the bulk properties of this evolution, including time-series evolution of global diagnostics, lateral averages of the 3D state, and the global 3D state. We find a variety of outcomes including quasi-equilibrium, localized runaway, and nova-like runaway. Our results suggest the double detonation progenitor model is promising, that 3D, dynamic convection plays a key role, and that these systems warrant further study.},

@article{Malone2014,
abstract = {Type I X-ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions of accreted material on the surface of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. Prior to the ignition of a subsonic burning front, runaway burning at the base of the accreted layer drives convection that mixes fuel and heavy-element ashes. In this paper, the second in a series, we explore the behavior of this low Mach number convection in mixed hydrogen/helium layers on the surface of a neutron star using two-dimensional simulations with the Maestro code. Maestro takes advantage of the highly subsonic flow field by filtering dynamically unimportant sound waves while retaining local compressibility effects, such as those due to stratification and energy release from nuclear reactions. In these preliminary calculations, we find that the rp-process approximate network creates a convective region that is split into two layers. While this splitting appears artificial due to the approximations of the network regarding nuclear flow out of the breakout reaction 18Ne({\$}\alpha{\$}, p)21Na, these calculations hint at further simplifications and improvements of the burning treatment for use in subsequent calculations in three dimensions for a future paper.},

Because the multiscale, multiphysics codes built in BoxLib are designed to solve complex systems at high resolution, performance on current and next generation architectures is essential. With the expectation of many more cores per node on next generation architectures, the ability to effectively utilize threads within a node is essential, and the current model for parallelization will not be sufficient. We describe a new version of BoxLib in which the tiling constructs are embedded so that BoxLib-based applications can easily realize expected performance gains without extra effort on the part of the application developer. We also discuss a path forward to enable future versions of BoxLib to take advantage of NUMA-aware optimizations using the TiDA portable library.},
